# CBSA COBOL isolated-test harness

This harness lets individual CBSA COBOL programs be **unit-tested in isolation
on Linux** with [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) (`cobc`) — no z/OS,
no CICS region, no Db2. It replaces the mainframe services a program depends on
with small, deterministic, inspectable COBOL *test doubles* (stubs), and it
rewrites the `EXEC CICS` verbs into ordinary `CALL`s to those stubs.

The original `src/base/cobol_src/*.cbl` and `src/base/cobol_copy/*.cpy` sources
are **never modified** — the harness consumes them as-is, so the exact same
sources still build for the mainframe.

## Quick start

```bash
# From the repository root:
tests/run.sh
# or:
make -C tests test
```

Requires `cobc` on the PATH (`sudo apt-get install -y gnucobol`). The script
compiles the shims, preprocesses + compiles each program under test, then
compiles and runs each unit test, exiting non-zero if any test fails.

## Layout

```
tests/
  run.sh                     # build + run everything (CI entry point)
  Makefile                   # `make test` / `make clean` wrappers
  harness/
    cicsPreprocessor.py      # EXEC CICS  ->  CALL translator
    copy/DFHEIBLK.cpy        # EIB shim copybook (injected into WORKING-STORAGE)
    shims/                   # the CICS test doubles (one module per verb group)
    README.md                # this file
  unit/                      # one test driver per program under test
  build/                     # generated (git-ignored): gensrc, modules, bins
```

## How the shim works

GnuCOBOL does not understand IBM's `EXEC CICS` / `EXEC SQL` statements, and the
programs reference EIB fields (`EIBTASKN`, `EIBRESP`, …) that CICS would supply.
The harness bridges the gap in two lightweight steps.

### 1. Source translation — `cicsPreprocessor.py`

A fixed-format-aware preprocessor reads a `.cbl` and emits a translated copy
(to `build/gensrc/`) that GnuCOBOL can compile. It:

* comments out compiler-directing lines (`CBL …`, `PROCESS …`);
* replaces `DFHRESP(name)` with its numeric value, **padded to the same width**
  so no columns shift (only `NORMAL` = 0 is needed today; extend `DFHRESP_MAP`);
* injects `COPY DFHEIBLK.` into `WORKING-STORAGE` and a `CALL 'CICSINIT'` at the
  top of the `PROCEDURE DIVISION` **only when the program references the EIB**,
  so the EIB fields resolve and are populated deterministically before use;
* rewrites each `EXEC CICS <verb> … END-EXEC` block into a `CALL` to a stub
  module, preserving the trailing period when present.

`EXEC CICS RETURN` is translated to `GOBACK` (it ends the CICS task, so control
must not fall through). Whole `EXEC` blocks are replaced with freshly generated
lines that stay within column 72; in-place edits are width-preserving.

### 2. Test doubles — `harness/shims/`

Each stub is a tiny, ordinary COBOL module compiled with `cobc -m`. Because
GnuCOBOL keeps a called module resident for the life of the process, stateful
stubs (the container store) are shared between the program under test and the
test driver.

| Stub       | Stubs verb(s)                       | Behaviour under test |
|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `CICSINIT` | (EIB init, injected)                | Sets `EIBRESP/EIBRESP2=0`, `EIBTRNID=spaces`, and `EIBTASKN` from `CBSA_TEST_TASKN` (default 1) — makes the RNG seed injectable. |
| `CICSCONT` | `GET CONTAINER`, `PUT CONTAINER`    | Process-resident container store keyed by name; `resp=0` on hit, `resp=1` (CONTAINERERR) on a GET miss. |
| `CICSDLAY` | `DELAY`                             | No-op by default (`resp=0`); set `CBSA_TEST_DELAY_MODE=real` to actually sleep. |
| `CICSLINK` | `LINK PROGRAM(..) COMMAREA(..)`     | Records the LINK (error-path only). |
| `CICSASGN` | `ASSIGN APPLID(..)`, `ASSIGN PROGRAM(..)` | Returns canned values (error-path only). |
| `CICSABND` | `ABEND ABCODE(..)`                  | Records the abend code (error-path only). |
| `CICSTIME` | `ASKTIME ABSTIME(..)`               | Returns a fixed ABSTIME (error-path only). |
| `CICSFTIM` | `FORMATTIME`                        | Returns a fixed date/time (error-path only). |

**CICS verbs stubbed so far:** `DELAY`, `GET CONTAINER`, `PUT CONTAINER`,
`RETURN`, `LINK`, `ASSIGN` (APPLID/PROGRAM), `ABEND`, `ASKTIME`, `FORMATTIME`.
`EXEC SQL` and other verbs (`ADDRESS`, `GETMAIN`, `RETRIEVE`, …) are **not** yet
stubbed — they are not used by the Layer-0 programs. Add them as needed (below).

### Determinism knobs (environment variables)

| Variable                | Default | Effect |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|
| `CBSA_TEST_TASKN`       | `1`     | Value placed in `EIBTASKN`; seeds `FUNCTION RANDOM`. |
| `CBSA_TEST_DELAY_MODE`  | `stub`  | `real` makes `CICSDLAY` actually sleep. |
| `COBC`                  | `cobc`  | Override the compiler binary. |

## Adding a new program under test

1. Add its base name (= `PROGRAM-ID`) to `programsUnderTest` in `run.sh`.
2. Write `tests/unit/<name>Test.cbl`: a COBOL main that builds the input
   (COMMAREA and/or seeds a container via `CICSCONT`), `CALL`s the program,
   inspects the outputs, and sets `RETURN-CODE` non-zero on any failed
   assertion (see the existing drivers for the pattern).
3. Run `tests/run.sh`. If it fails to translate, the program probably uses an
   `EXEC CICS`/`EXEC SQL` verb not yet handled — add it (below).

## Adding a new CICS verb stub

1. **Preprocessor:** add a branch in `_translate_block()` in
   `cicsPreprocessor.py` that maps the verb's operands to a `CALL`. Pass data
   items `BY REFERENCE` and literals `BY CONTENT`.
2. **Stub module:** add `harness/shims/<MODULE>.cbl` (a `PROGRAM-ID` whose name
   matches the module file). Keep behaviour deterministic and inspectable.
3. For a new `DFHRESP(...)` condition, add it to `DFHRESP_MAP`.
4. Re-run `tests/run.sh`.

Naming convention: shell/Python/config identifiers use **camelCase**
(`cicsPreprocessor.py`, `run.sh` variables); COBOL modules keep the repo's
UPPERCASE `PROGRAM-ID` convention.
